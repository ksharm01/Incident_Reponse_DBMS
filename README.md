Title: Incident Response Database Management

Tool: Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 

This project encompasses a robust incident response system database designed for comprehensive incident management and analysis. It captures diverse information, including employee details, assets, incident reports, alerts, investigations, resolutions, and more. The database structure supports a systematic approach to incident handling, allowing for streamlined management, investigation, and resolution. It empowers organizations to track incidents, analyze trends, and ensure swift, informed responses to security threats.

I have used some of the advanced SQL Functionalities including:
1) Stored Procedures
2) Views
3) Cursors
4) Audit Table 
5) Triggers for Audit Table

This is full-fledged project that can be used for showcasing intermediate to advanced SQL Functionalities.
